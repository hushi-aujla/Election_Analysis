 ## Challenge Overview
 
 ## Election Audit Summary
 The python script created in this challenge has shown to be very useful in providing quickly readable results in a local election. We moddified the scrpit to display vote results by county which could be usuful information for a candidate running in a future campaign. Some ways we could modify the python script to improve it even more would be to possible calculate the number of voters each candidate received by county. This could also help potential politicians in future campaigns uncover which areas of the state they should focus their attention on. Another way we could modify the script is to change the scope from counties to states if we wanted to run a federal election, or on a smaller scale we could modify the script to run something like a school election to figure out the next class president.
